### Date: 05 February 2026

#### Who did you help this week?

N/A (This was the first supervision meeting).

#### What helped you this week?

The meeting with Jørgen and Veronika helped clarify the direction for the project.

#### What did you achieve?

* Agreed on Project Scope & Data:

  * Dataset: MIMIC-IV-ECG (approx. 800,000 ECGs, 160,000 patients).

  * Data specs: 12 leads, 10 seconds long, 500 Hz (5,000 points), WFDB format 16.

  * Source: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2008–2019).

* Methodology:

  * Build a CNN-based autoencoder to explore the latent space (e.g., to find AFib clusters).

  * Apply dimensionality reduction (UMAP/t-SNE) to visualize vectors (e.g., 64 dimensions to x/y coordinates).

  * Training will occur on Jørgen’s hardware.

* Practicalities:

  * Fixed days: ITU on Thursday afternoons, KU on Tuesdays.

  * Project Title: "Project of Anton - Unsupervised Deep Learning of ECGs: Exploring the Latent Space".

#### What did you struggle with?

* Uncertainty regarding the direction of the project and administrative access (seeing the thesis in LearnIT and getting access to KU's systems).

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Call SAP to check LearnIT access, confirm title registration, and clarify problem statement deadlines.

  * Register supervisor with SAP using the title: "Project of Anton - Unsupervised Deep Learning of ECGs: Exploring the Latent Space".

* Set up a regular GitHub repository ([Template](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science)) and create a WeeklyMeetings.md file.

* Set up Overleaf in a separate repository ([Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn)).

* Create README and Requirements files.

* Draft the Problem Statement.

* Create a flowchart for Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and Methods.

* Review guidelines for writing.

* Check ECG file consistency and create a log-file (Task assigned by Jørgen 06/02).

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Providing feedback for the Problem Statement.

#### Any other topics

* Availability: I have a 15-hour side job to balance with the thesis.

* Vacation: I have 2 weeks of vacation planned for March.
